# unsupervised-RNN
The aim of this project is to train an RNN in an unsupervised fashion such that it can discover some clusters.
You will see the word 'sentiment' a lot in the code. It is because I'm hoping that either the network 'magically' 
discovers sentiment or I can come up with a better of discovering sentiment. The RNN is currently trained as a Language
Model on IMDB sentiment analysis dataset. Since I expect the sentiment to have a strong presence in this dataset, maybe 
the RNN can actually discover sentiment 'magically'.
